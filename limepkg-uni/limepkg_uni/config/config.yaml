# Here you can define limetypes to be presented.
# The structure is as follows:
# limetypes:
#   example_limetype: 
#     presentation_alias: database_key
#
# The presentation alias is the name by which the variable is displayed in the app.
# These can be named whatever you'd like, with the exception of these special keywords: 
#   title          - Becomes the title (header) of the item.                     (required)
#   secondary_text - Displayed underneath the header.                            (not required) 
#   status         - Determines what variable decides priority.                  (required) 
#   prio           - List of possible values from 'status' that decide priority. (required)
#                    Each value should contain a unique number afterwards that
#                    decides its priority (position on the x axis of the app,  
#                    1 being the leftmost)
#   
# Restrictions:
#   Due to the nature of the database-API, there are certain restrictions 
#   on what data can be retrieved and displayed: 
#     DateTime   - DateTime variables are currently not handled by the database-api
#                  and therefore cannot be returned. (?)
#     Duplicates - The database-api does not handle duplicates, and will not return
#                  the same variable under two different aliases. This means that 
#                  we can not use a variable both as status and as secondary_text
#                  for example. (?)
